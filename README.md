# US_Bikeshare_Project_Udacity

Under the umbrella of the Digital Egypt Strategy, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) launches the Future Work is Digital initiative powered by Information Technology Industry Development Agency (ITIDA) to equip and train 200,000 young Egyptians through Udacity an online learning platform for digital technologies and skills to digital work and local market opportunities.

In this project, I used Python scripts to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I write a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about the data by computing descriptive statistics.
